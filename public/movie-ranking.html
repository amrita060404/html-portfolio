<h1>The Best Movies According to Amrita</h1>
<h2>My top movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Fantastic Beasts and Where to find them</h3>
<p>Hogwarts is my home. I will forever be a Harry Potter fan. I loved evrything about this movie especially how each character is dealt with. I love the diversity of morally good to morally grey characters. I love the male lead not being streotypically masculine. I love the fantasy and magical elements of it. </p>
<h3>Coco</h3>
<p>This film deserved its oscar. As a child reading I read about Coco winning the oscar in the times of India that each kid in my class was being provided to improve our English. Randomly, I found it downloaded in the laptop of someone in my family and since then my life has been BC (Before Coco) and AC (After Coco). It is one of those movies that you will convince your friends to watch otherwise their life is incomplete. It caters to the child in everyone and tugs at our heartstrings, reminding us to not forget those before us. It is really a family that proomotes harmony and potrays family relations in good light, which is desperately needed since we are surrounded by the negativity of dark incidents on news and social media all the time.</p>
<h3>Pride and Prejudice</h3>
<p>Everything written by Jane Austen sings to my heart. It makes my heart feel so content and satisfied. I tried to figure it out for the longest time and have come to the conclusion that it is because as a women I see my feelings resonated. Women can be both good and bad, they can have feelings of love as well as jealousy. To have human emotions as a women, even the negative ones, and not be potrayed as either the best women in the world or the most insecure villain is something consoles my heart. The writing, the twists, the development of each character and the happy ending, are all elements of this movie that are dear to my heart.</p>
